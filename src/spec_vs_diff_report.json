  "summary": "The diff implements deployment-related configurations and mainnet reliability improvements (error handling, loading states, retry functionality, graceful asset fallbacks) across frontend components. However, there is no evidence of actual deployment execution (REQ-45), production canister configuration (REQ-48), or deployment verification (REQ-46, REQ-47, REQ-49). The diff focuses on making the frontend more robust for mainnet conditions but does not show the deployment process itself.",
